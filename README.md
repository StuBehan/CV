# Skills

## Teamwork

In the Royal Air Force, I have worked in large and small teams at home and abroad, I have deployed as an individual augmentee, demonstrating my ability to fit into an established team. I have developed a sound understanding of the dynamism between followership and leadership and can move fluidly between the two as the situation dictates. Most recently, working on group projects with other Makers Academy students I have used these skills to great effect, our teams going on to produce quality results.

## Communication

Throughout my career I have had to brief audiences large and small regarding highly technical aspects of aircraft components, sometimes to audiences who weren’t engineers themselves. 

## Leadership

As a Junior Non-Commissioned Officer, I had the pleasure of leading teams carrying out a diverse array of tasks, from dangerous goods movements to leading a section of 8 persons on a dynamic high pressure Explosive Ordnance Disposal exercise . The challenge of leadership is its greatest reward, and has pushed me to develop my emotional intelligence, as maintaining a high level of performance requires a leader to understand the individual needs of their team. Whilst studying at Makers Academy it was apparent that across disciplines, effective leadership requires similar skills.

## Management

Experience managing assets in the millions of GBP including aircraft components, weapons, and explosive natures. I spent a great deal of my time effectively contacting external agencies, including project teams, to develop modifications and repairs for aircraft components that would allow the recovery of assets and saving millions in taxpayer funds. I conducted daily stand up meetings for the aircraft launcher workshop and managed shift rotas.
