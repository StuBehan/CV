# Skills

## Teamwork

In the Royal Air Force, I have worked in large and small teams at home and abroad, I have deployed as an individual augmentee, demonstrating my ability to fit into an established team. I have developed a sound understanding of the dynamism between followership and leadership and can move fluidly between the two as the situation dictates. Most recently, working on group projects with other Makers Academy students I have used these skills to great effect, our teams going on to produce quality results.

## Communication

Throughout my career I have had to brief audiences large and small regarding highly technical aspects of aircraft components, sometimes to audiences who weren’t engineers themselves. 

## Leadership

As a Junior Non-Commissioned Officer, I had the pleasure of managing teams carrying out a diverse array of tasks, from dangerous goods movements to leading a section of 8 persons on a dynamic high pressure Explosive Ordnance Disposal exercise . The challenge of leadership is its greatest reward, and has pushed me to develop my emotional intelligence, as maintaining a high level of performance requires a leader to understand the individual needs of their team. Whilst studying at Makers Academy it was apparent that across disciplines, effective leadership requires similar skills.

## Management

- Organised movement of thousands of life-expired and damaged flares from RAF Wittering to MOD Shoeburyness for disposal. 
- Formalised contact with the depot at shoeburyness to arrange the disposal, ensuring suitable, experienced personnel were available for the movement at both ends. 
- Arranged suitably inspected, licensed vehicles and notified the police of the intention to move large amounts of attractive cargo, providing information regarding the route.
- Resulting in the successful delivery and disposal of the flares, saving the MOD money compared to outsourcing the movement to a private contractor.
